[![Build](https://github.com/manics/guacamole-client/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manics/guacamole-client/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is a fork of https://github.com/apache/guacamole-client with some customisations for https://github.com/manics/jupyter-guacamole

The main changes are:
- A `jupyternotatre-auth` extension module which allows a single connection to be configured using environment variables.
- Minor user interface changes to the web application.
